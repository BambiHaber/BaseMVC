 Having ES6 with module imports and several build tools at hand I believe we can have a very stable JS application environments that would not be a hit and miss, or a "trendy FW" like a totally transpiled language, or a component only closed based framework, just by having a library and some "aids" that would make us keep a correct design pattern while writing.

This is a very first attempt at this.

Lets see if it goes..

Documents about to come.
but basically

> npm install

 the package, and

> npm run build

, then

> npm run browserDemo

hope everything works.. ;)




# Changelog
* 1.0.0 - First version, contains a Base Model, View, and Collection.   Controller is the future opinionated way of wiring things together.
            theres a first step in assembling an inheritance for an eventbus library as all entities would be "eventable".

            Main goal would be to create an engine of some sort which can parse controller files to actual working bundled units.
